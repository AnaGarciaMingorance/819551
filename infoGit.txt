Make sure that you are on the master branch. This will be the case if you just forked, otherwise switch to master.

$ git checkout master




####
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master

git fetch downloads the latest from remote without trying to merge or rebase anything.

Then the git reset resets the master branch to what you just fetched. The --hard option changes all the files in your working tree to match the files in origin/master, !!! so if you have any local changes, they will be lost. With or without --hard, any local commits that haven't been pushed will be lost.

$ git checkout master

Already on 'master'
Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 2 and 1 different commit each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)

$ git pull

Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.

git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master

git fetch downloads the latest from remote without trying to merge or rebase anything.

Then the git reset resets the master branch to what you just fetched. The --hard option changes all the files in your working tree to match the files in origin/master, !!! so if you have any local changes, they will be lost. With or without --hard, any local commits that haven't been pushed will be lost.
